		<h2>Lesson 1:The Basics Of Web And HTML</h2>
		<div>
			<b>How The Web Works</b>
			<p>The Web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.
				When we(our browsers) makes request to the server through internet with the help
				of <em>http</em> protocol,server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
                it back to the user's computer where a web browser
                interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

        	<b>HTML Basics</b>
        	<p>HTML is a standard markup to create web pages and controls the structure of Web page.HTML stans for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>.HTML consists of text content,markup,references to other document and link to other pages.<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-ud000/l-4185478836/m-48724340">This link</a> will take you to the video which will explain you more in detail.

        	<b>Tags And Elements</b>
        	<p>
        		HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.For example,<em>b tag</em> is used for making the text bold.<a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud000/lessons/4182108546/concepts/487234440923#">This link</a> will take you to the video which will explain you more in detail.

        	<b>Computers Are Stupid</b>
        	<p>
        		Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

        <div>
        	<b>Inline vs Block</b>
        	<p>
        		HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an <span><b>invisible box</b><span> around the content inside of them.Some of the block elements are p,form and div elements.Examples of inline elements are a,br,img,b and many more.<a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud000/lessons/4182108546/concepts/487234380923#">This link</a> will take you to the video which will explain you more in detail.

    	<h2>Lesson 2:Creating A Structured Document</h2>
        <div>
        	<b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b>
        	<p>
        		"Tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside them.We can make HTML document structured by using many tags,one of the example being <em>div</em> tag.Browses turn the HTML tag into elements which forms a tree-like structure called DOM tree.

        	<b>HTML-CSS-DOM</b>
        	<p>
        		HTML:It controls the structure of web page.<br>
        		CSS:It controls the style of the web page.<br>
        		DOM(Document Object Model):Browsers turn the HTML tags into elements that forms a tree like structure called DOM.<a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud000/lessons/4158148765/concepts/25961388150923#">This video</a> will explain you more in detail.
